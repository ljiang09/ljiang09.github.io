		<h2 class="title center">Iteration 1</h2>

		<p class="headerDate italic center">
			Released January 2022
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			I used UV mapping processes to make a 2D image (drawn with digital software like Procreate) wrap onto the user's 3D face geometry. This gave a semi-realistic filter that moved with the user's facial movements.

		<p class="description center">
			This iteration also eventually included a rudimentary authentication feature (using Firebase), which pushed Sebela towards a more profile-based, social-media style app.

		<h2 class="title center">Iteration 2</h2>

		<p class="headerDate italic center">
			Completed July 2022 (unreleased)
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			We pivoted to focusing on bettering the AR accuracy. Unity had stronger technology than Apple did, so I tried making the UI using Unity 2D for easier integration with Unity's technology.
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			Additionally, we made the app more social media based. Now the importance was in user authentication and personal branding rather than trying on makeup with AR tech.

		<h2 class="title center">Iteration 3</h2>

		<p class="headerDate italic center">
			In progress; projected release November 2022
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			We pivoted back to native Swift, with Unity integration. UI building in Unity was unnecessarily difficult, especially with displaying videos for the tutorials.
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			Users can "like" posts they see.
		</p>

		<p class="description center">
			User profiles are a lot more fleshed out now as they're able to see their posts, likes, followers, and followings.
