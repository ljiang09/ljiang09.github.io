        "I used UV mapping processes to make a 2D image (drawn with digital software like Procreate) wrap onto the user's 3D face geometry. This gave a semi-realistic filter that moved with the user's facial movements.",
        "I coded the full functionality of this app, from the interface to the user experience to the communication with backend servers.",
        "This iteration also eventually included a rudimentary authentication feature (using Firebase), which pushed Sebela towards a more profile-based, social-media style app.",

        "Completed July 2022 (unreleased)",
        "We pivoted to focusing on bettering the AR accuracy. Unity had stronger technology than Apple did, so I tried making the UI using Unity 2D for easier integration with Unity's technology.",
        "Additionally, we made the app more social media based. Now the importance was in user authentication and personal branding rather than trying on makeup with AR tech.",
