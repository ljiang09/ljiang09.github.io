        <p>
            A keystroke logger for Linux devices. Created in C.

        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <div class="description">
            - Create a C program that, upon being started, immediately backgrounds itself
            to prevent being easily noticed, identified, and easily killed.
            <br> <br>
            - The program logs the user's keystroke information, and sends
            batches of information periodically over a TCP socket to be stored
            in a server.
        </div>

        <br>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <div class="description">
            - In charge of keystroke logging
            <br> <br>
            - Gathered and parsed keystroke event data from the device using
            the libevdev library
            <br> <br>
            - Created custom data structures to store keystroke information
            <br> <br>
            - Interfaced keystroke capabilities with client-side functionality
        </div>

        <br>

        <h2>Project Deliverable</h2>

        <!-- <h3>Code Architecture</h3>

        <p>We split our functionality into a Model, View, Controller architecture for cleanliness and easy navigation.</p>

        <img src="images/DesktopPetArchitecture.png" alt="A diagram representing the model, view, controller interactions" class="projectImage1 removeBg" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"> -->

        <h3>Keylogging</h3>
    
        <p>
            The libevdev library, with sudo permissions, provides the ability to
            gather event info from all input sources on the device (USB ports,
            built-in keyboard, laptop lid, etc).
        </p>

        <div class="description">
            How the keylogging works:
            <br> <br>
            - Open the keyboard input event file (on my specific device, the
            location is /dev/input/event3)
            <br> <br>
            - In an infinite while loop, continuously check the status of the keyboard
            event with the `libevdev_next_event` function
            <br> <br>
            - Every time a key is pressed (or pressed and held), the key(s) are stored in an array
            <br> <br>
            - Every few seconds, the array of keys is packaged into a custom data
            struct that also stores the time of packaging and the device's
            user-assigned name.
            <br> <br>
            - After the key info is packaged, it is serialized and transported through the socket.
        </div>

        <!-- <h3>Animations</h3>

        <p>
            While the sprite moved around, we wanted to have animations to match it walking in different directions. To accomplish
            this, we switched between various images during the game loop, following a pattern to make it appear that the cat was
            putting one foot in front of the other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because it was difficult and memory-inefficient to keep track of all the images per animation, we utilized a sprite sheet.
            This was essentially all these images placed onto one image next to each other.
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="images/DesktopPetSpriteSheet.png" alt="The sprite sheet" class="projectImage2 removeBg" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;">
        </div>

        <p>
            In this sprite sheet, each row represents a direction of movement, while each column represents one frame. The sprite sheet
            is cropped into just 1 cat, which is what is displayed in the program. The changing the frame within the animation involves
            changing the position of the cropping within the sprite sheet.
        </p>

        <h3>Points of Improvement</h3>
    
        <div class="description">
            - Gathering input data from external keyboards. Connected to USB ports, and Bluetooth
            <br> <br>
            - Enabling the program to work on multiple device types (with different input event numberings)
        </div>
