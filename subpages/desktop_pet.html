        Created in C.

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <div class="description">
        - Create a program that displays a desktop pet that randomly wanders
        around the screen
        <br />
        <br />
        - Occasionally, the program prompts interaction with the user
      </div>

      <br />

      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <div class="description">
        - In charge of sprite movement around screen
        <br />
        <br />
        - Implemented natural-looking path finding algorithm, along with
        boundary box handling
        <br />
        <br />
        - Integrated animation sequence into existing movement loop
        <br />
        <br />
        - Create speed-changing feature upon user input
      </div>

      <h2>Project Deliverable</h2>

      <h3>Code Architecture</h3>

      <p>
        We split our functionality into a Model, View, Controller architecture
        for cleanliness and easy navigation.
      </p>

      <img
        src="images/DesktopPetArchitecture.png"
        alt="A diagram representing the model, view, controller interactions"
        class="projectImage1 removeBg"
        style="mix-blend-mode: multiply"
      />

      <h3>Pathing</h3>

      <p>
        The pet moved on one axis at a time. We represented the 4 directions
        with integers from [0-3], and implemented an option for the pet to idle
        in place (represented by the integer 4). Upon approaching a window
        bound, the pet reverses direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        With every game loop, the pet's next direction would be generated
        semi-randomly. The direction would be weighted in favor of the previous
        direction, with a 52% chance of repeating the previous movement (and 12%
        for all other options). This allowed for more natural, non-circular
        paths that traversed the whole range of the screen.
      </p>

      <div class="center">
        <img
          src="images/DesktopPetDirections.png"
          alt="A diagram illustrating how we represented the directions using integers"
          class="projectImage3 removeBg"
          style="mix-blend-mode: multiply"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>Animations</h3>

      <p>
        While the sprite moved around, we wanted to have animations to match it
        walking in different directions. To accomplish this, we switched between
        various images during the game loop, following a pattern to make it
        appear that the cat was putting one foot in front of the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it was difficult and memory-inefficient to keep track of all the
        images per animation, we utilized a sprite sheet. This was essentially
        all these images placed onto one image next to each other.
      </p>

      <div class="center">
        <img
          src="images/DesktopPetSpriteSheet.png"
          alt="The sprite sheet"
          class="projectImage2 removeBg"
          style="mix-blend-mode: multiply"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In this sprite sheet, each row represents a direction of movement, while
        each column represents one frame. The sprite sheet is cropped into just
        1 cat, which is what is displayed in the program. The changing the frame
        within the animation involves changing the position of the cropping
        within the sprite sheet.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h3>User Interaction</h3>

      <p>
        In addition to the sprite randomly moving around, the user can also
        control some aspects. Clicking the cat changes its color, while pressing
        the space bar randomly changes the cat's speed.
      </p>
